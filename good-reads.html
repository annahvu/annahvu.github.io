			<h3>Self</h3>
				<p>Being awake means we're conscious of what's going on inside us, as it happens, and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3023459/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/12-tools-for-more-mindful-living" target="_blank">so can make more conscious choices rather than acting on our impulses all the time.</a> <b>|</b> Passion comes from hard work. Passion bubbles up from intense, sometimes tedious labour. <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/ask-polly-why-dont-i-have-a-passion.html" target="_blank"> Passion floats in when you're exhausted from doing something by yourself, for yourself, just to survive.</a> <b>|</b> You are worth your weight in gold, but don't think for a second that you're a prize to be won, like a pile of chips on the table. <a href="http://theoffingmag.com/dead-letter-office/youre-not-special/" target="_blank">You're as lovely and common and necessary as air.</a> <a id="read-1" data-index="1"><b>Read more &#10095;</b></a>
				<span id="text-1"><b>| </b> There is a motif, in fiction and in life, of people having wonderful things happen to them, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/how-to-build-a-happier-brain/280752/" target="_blank"> but still ending up unhappy.</a> <b>|</b> The hotel is, of course, an ideal place for cerebral brooding; hotels are, by their nature, in between. <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/09/23/girls-moping-in-hotels/" target="_blank">It is where you sleep, but it is not your home.</a></span>

			<h3>Relationships</h3>
				<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/how-friendships-change-over-time-in-adulthood/411466/" target="_blank">Friendships are unique relationships because unlike family relationships, we choose to enter into them.</a> And unlike other voluntary bonds, like marriages and romantic relationships, they lack a formal structure. <b>|</b> This type of attention to a lover's intelligence - and to those facets of character that fall under the auspices of intelligence and factor into respect, such as fairness, integrity, magnanimity, and sensitivity - <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-ideal-marriage-according-to-novels" target="_blank">is consistent with the way women novelists have long written about love.</a> <b>|</b> Most of our courtship narratives are still romantic, which really tends to obscure the <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/05/shine-theory-how-to-stop-female-competition.html" target="_blank">importance of friendship's early stages.</a> <a id="read-2" data-index="2"><b>Read more &#10095;</b></a> <span id="text-2"><b>|</b> "I see a lot of anxiety and unhappiness in people who try to plan out their love lives too carefully or who try to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/insider/inside-modern-love.html" target="_blank">forecast how happy they'll be based on certain choices they make"</a> <b>|</b> One night, drunk at 2 a.m., I was trying to decipher if an innocuous Drake lyric he tweeted could somehow be directed at me as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/style/swearing-off-the-modern-man.html" target="_blank">a possible admission of affection.</a></span>

			<h3>Creativity</h3>
				<p>"I think that my job is to observe people and the world, and not to judge them. I always hope to position myself away from so-called conclusions. <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2/the-art-of-fiction-no-182-haruki-murakami" target="_blank">I would like to leave everything wide open to all the possibilities in the world</a>" <b>|</b> <a href="http://www.thebookoflife.org/the-great-artists-cy-twombly/" target="_blank">Twombly's career was devoted to making portraits of inner life</a> so that we might learn to communicate its fruits to other people. Getting others to share our experiences is notoriously difficult. <b>|</b> Design is a rather broad and vague term. <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3032719/ui-ux-who-does-what-a-designers-guide-to-the-tech-industry" target="_blank">When someone says "I'm a designer," it is not immediately clear what they actually do day to day.</a> <a id="read-3" data-index="3"><b>Read more &#10095;</b></a> <span id="text-3"><b>|</b> The most common mood lines can be easily seen in practice - the vertical line indicating <a href="http://www.zevendesign.com/mood-lines-giving-designs-attitude/" target="_blank">"noble, dramatic, inspirational, aspiring"</a> <b>|</b> "I think the greatest stroke of luck in my life is that <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/09/how-curiosity-leads-to-creativity.html" target="_blank">I'm 1 percent more curious than I am terrified</a>"</span>

			<h3>Technology</h3>
				<p>Code has been my life, and it has been your life, too. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">It is time to understand how it all works</a> <b>|</b> I learned that by creating difference instead of competition, you can offer unique value and expertise that compliments your cohorts, builds you an excellent reputation, <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2015/10/26/find-your-specialty-to-compete-in-tech/" target="_blank">gives you a distinct voice, and helps you stand out.</a> <b>|</b> Newsletters cater to people who want to stay informed without feeling like a slave to the Twitter stream - <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3033338/most-creative-people/tips-on-crafting-a-popular-newsletter-from-top-newsletter-authors" target="_blank">all the news you can use is waiting in a hand-crafted email sitting in your inbox.</a> <a id="read-4" data-index="4"><b>Read more &#10095;</b></a> <span id="text-4"><b> |</b> Friendships, relationships, work, activism, commerce, and so many other forms of social connections take place digitally. <a href="https://tech.safehubcollective.org/cybersecurity/" target="_blank">As we thrive in these internet spaces, harassment and violence along intersecting axes of oppression are felt with unchecked force.</a> <b>|</b> </b><a href="http://econsultancy.com/blog/67248-the-a-z-of-digital-transformation" target="_blank">The A-Z of digital transformation</a></span>
